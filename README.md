# Inter-individual variability of MEP amplitudes predicted from Input-Output Curves


Title: Inter-Individual Variability in Motor Output Is Driven by Recruitment Gain in the Corticospinal Tract Rather Than Motor Threshold (https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12101401)

The project aims at using parameters from the input-output curve of healthy subjects (n= 75) to predict MEP amplitude at 120% of resting motor threshold and its inter-individual variability. For this we used general linear models and random forest models.

The code is written in MATLAB and R. The scripts are numbered in the order of analysis steps performed.
